Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains a Python script for predicting Apple Inc.'s stock prices using machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree Regressor and Linear Regression. The script loads historical stock price data, preprocesses it, trains two different models, and visualizes their predictions.

Prerequisites
Before using this script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
You can install these libraries using pip if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named "aapl.csv." It should contain at least two columns: "Date" and "Close" where "Date" represents the date of the stock price and "Close" represents the closing price of Apple's stock on that date.

Usage
Clone this repository and place the "aapl.csv" dataset file in the same directory as the script.

Run the Python script.

bash
Copy code
python stock_price_prediction.py
The script will perform the following steps:

Initial data exploration, displaying the first few rows of the dataset and its dimensions.
Data visualization to show Apple's historical stock prices.
Data preprocessing, where the "Close" prices are used to predict future stock prices. You can adjust the number of future days to predict by modifying the futureDays variable in the script.
The script builds and trains two machine learning models:

Decision Tree Regressor
Linear Regression
It then makes predictions for future stock prices using both models and displays the predicted prices.

Finally, it visualizes the predictions along with the original stock prices for both models.

Results
The script provides two sets of predictions: one from the Decision Tree Regressor model and another from the Linear Regression model. The predictions are displayed alongside the actual stock prices, allowing you to assess the accuracy and performance of both models.

Important Notes
This script serves as a basic example of stock price prediction using machine learning and does not take into account various factors that can influence stock prices in real-world scenarios. Real-world stock price prediction typically requires more sophisticated models and a wider range of features.
It's important to note that the performance of these models may vary, and their predictions should not be used for actual trading decisions without further validation and refinement.

Acknowledgments
The script was created for educational purposes and is inspired by various machine learning tutorials and examples.
The stock price data used in this example is for demonstration purposes and may not reflect actual market conditions.
Feel free to adapt and modify this script for your specific use case or to explore and experiment with different machine learning models for stock price prediction.
